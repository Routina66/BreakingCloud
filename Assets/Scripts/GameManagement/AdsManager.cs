/// Adversiting policy:
/// 
/// A single banner will be displayed when the end of screen
/// information is displayed. The rest of the time it will be
/// hidden. The banner will be placed in a place where the player 
/// cannot press it by mistake. The banner is updated:
///     - When the player presses it.
///     - When the end level information is shown.
///     
/// The player will be offered the possibility of viewing a 
/// rewarded advertisement:
///     - At the beginning a level, to get some improvement.
///     - When a level is finished, to multiply the reward.
///     
/// A midgame ad will occasionally be displayed when the player 
/// finishes a level. The following criteria will be 
/// followed to display the ad:
///     - The first ad will be shown after the player 
///       has completed 5 matches without seeing any rewarded ads.
///     - When the player sees a rewarded ad, the number of games increases by 1. 
///       In this way, if the player sees a rewarded ad, 
///       a midgame will not be shown until after 6 games without seeing rewarded ads. 
///       When the player sees another rewarded, the number of games increases to 7,Etc.
///     - When the ad is shown, the number of games without seeing rewarded ads increases 
///       by one so that the second migame is shown after 6 games without seeing rewarded ads,
///       the third after 7, etc. This sum is accumulated with that of the previous step.
///     - If the player sees rewarded ads often, 
///       they will be able to play without seeing any midgame ads.
